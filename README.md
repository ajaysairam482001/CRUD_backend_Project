# CRUD_backend_Project
Its just my first back-end Java development project consisting of CRUD operations which can be stored on a database using MySQL. I also used a web service (aiven.io) to provide me the database service to save the user data in its server.
and also used to send HTTP requests to perform the CRUD operations in the databases
